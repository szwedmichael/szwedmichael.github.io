          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Exercise Matters for Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Regular physical activity offers numerous benefits for people with Type 1 diabetes:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Improved insulin sensitivity:</strong> Exercise makes your cells more responsive to insulin, often reducing insulin requirements</li>
            <li><strong>Better cardiovascular health:</strong> Reduces risk of heart disease, a major concern for people with diabetes</li>
            <li><strong>Weight management:</strong> Helps maintain healthy body weight and composition</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced mood:</strong> Reduces stress, anxiety, and depression</li>
            <li><strong>Lower A1C:</strong> Regular activity can improve long-term blood sugar control</li>
            <li><strong>Increased energy:</strong> Improves overall fitness and stamina</li>
            <li><strong>Better sleep:</strong> Physical activity promotes quality sleep</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How Different Types of Exercise Affect Blood Sugar</h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Not all exercise affects glucose the same way. Understanding these differences helps you predict and manage blood sugar responses.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Aerobic (Cardio) Exercise</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Activities like running, cycling, swimming, walking, and dancing use large muscle groups continuously and typically <strong>lower blood sugar</strong> during and after exercise.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Why it lowers glucose:</strong> Your muscles use glucose for fuel during aerobic activity. As blood sugar drops, your body typically releases less insulin (or in your case, you need less injected insulin) to allow muscles to access glucose. Since you can't reduce insulin already in your system, you're at risk for hypoglycemia if you have too much active insulin during or after aerobic exercise.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Duration matters:</strong> Short bursts (15-20 minutes) may have minimal impact, while extended sessions (45+ minutes) significantly increase hypoglycemia risk, especially if you have active insulin on board.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Anaerobic (High-Intensity) Exercise</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Activities like sprinting, weightlifting, HIIT workouts, and competitive sports can actually <strong>raise blood sugar</strong> temporarily.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Why it raises glucose:</strong> High-intensity exercise triggers your body's "fight or flight" response, releasing stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones signal your liver to release stored glucose for quick energy, sometimes faster than your muscles can use it, resulting in temporary high blood sugar.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>The rebound effect:</strong> After the initial spike, blood sugar often drops significantly as your body recovers and muscles continue using glucose to replenish energy stores. This can happen hours after your workout ends.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Mixed Activity</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Many activities combine aerobic and anaerobic elements (basketball, soccer, tennis, interval training). These create unpredictable blood sugar patterns. You might see spikes during intense moments and drops during sustained activity. Continuous glucose monitoring is especially valuable for these mixed activities.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Pre-Workout Blood Sugar Management</h2>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Check Your Starting Glucose</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Checking blood sugar before exercising helps inform your approach. Your healthcare team can help you develop personalized guidelines for when it may be helpful to have a snack before activity, when to proceed with caution, and when it might be best to wait.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            General considerations that many healthcare providers discuss with their patients include checking for ketones when glucose is significantly elevated, and having fast-acting carbs available if glucose is on the lower end of your personal range. Your specific thresholds and strategies should be developed with your healthcare team.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Consider Insulin on Board (IOB)</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Active insulin dramatically increases hypoglycemia risk during exercise. If you have significant IOB from a recent meal or correction:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Wait 2-3 hours after bolusing before exercising, if possible</li>
            <li>Consume extra carbs before and during activity</li>
            <li>Reduce exercise intensity or duration</li>
            <li>Monitor glucose more frequently</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Adjust Basal Insulin</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If using an insulin pump, you can reduce your basal rate 60-90 minutes before exercise (typically by 30-80% depending on activity intensity and duration). For those on long-acting insulin injections, planning is more challenging since you can't reduce basal insulin that's already absorbed. You'll need to rely more on carb intake and strategic timing.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Pre-Exercise Snack Guidelines</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If starting glucose is in a good range but you have insulin on board or plan extended activity:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Short workout (20-30 min):</strong> 0-15g carbs</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate workout (30-60 min):</strong> 15-30g carbs</li>
            <li><strong>Long workout (60+ min):</strong> 30-45g carbs, or more depending on intensity</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Choose easily digestible carbs like fruit, granola bars, or sports drinks. Avoid taking insulin for these pre-workout carbs unless your blood sugar is already high.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">During-Workout Strategies</h2>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Monitor Frequently</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If using a CGM, watch your glucose trends. For longer workouts, check blood sugar every 30 minutes if not using CGM. Look for:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Rapid drops (more than 50 mg/dL per hour)</li>
            <li>Trends showing single or double arrows down</li>
            <li>Any reading below 90 mg/dL</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Carry Fast-Acting Carbs</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Always have glucose tablets, sports drinks, or gels accessible. For activities lasting over 45 minutes, consume 15-30g carbs every 30-60 minutes, depending on your glucose trends.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Know When to Stop</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Stop exercising immediately if:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Blood sugar drops below 70 mg/dL</li>
            <li>You experience hypoglycemia symptoms (shakiness, confusion, rapid heartbeat)</li>
            <li>Blood sugar is rising rapidly above 300 mg/dL (especially with high-intensity exercise)</li>
            <li>You feel dizzy, excessively fatigued, or unwell</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Post-Workout Blood Sugar Management</h2>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">The Extended Impact</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Exercise can affect <a href="understanding-blood-sugar-guide.html" class="text-pink-600 hover:underline">blood sugar</a> for up to 24-48 hours after you finish. Your muscles continue absorbing glucose to replenish energy stores, and your insulin sensitivity remains elevated. This is why many athletes experience unexpected overnight lows after afternoon or evening workouts.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Recovery Nutrition</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            After exercise, your muscles are particularly efficient at absorbing glucose. Consider:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Eating a balanced snack or meal with carbs and protein within 30-60 minutes post-workout</li>
            <li>Reducing <a href="insulin-101-types-timing-optimization.html" class="text-pink-600 hover:underline">insulin doses</a> for post-workout meals by 25-50%</li>
            <li>Choosing moderate GI carbs rather than high GI for more stable recovery</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Basal Insulin Adjustments</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For pump users, consider reducing basal rates by 10-30% for several hours after exercise, especially if working out in the evening. For those on long-acting insulin, you may need to reduce your nightly dose by 1-2 units after particularly intense or long exercise days, or ensure you have a bedtime snack.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Overnight Monitoring</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            After late afternoon or evening exercise:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Set CGM alerts for overnight lows</li>
            <li>Check blood sugar before bed (aim for 130-150 mg/dL)</li>
            <li>Have a bedtime snack with protein and carbs if needed</li>
            <li>Consider setting an alarm to check glucose at 2-3 AM</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Exercise-Specific Strategies</h2>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Running and Cycling (Endurance Cardio)</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Reduce basal insulin 60-90 minutes before starting</li>
            <li>Start with glucose 120-150 mg/dL</li>
            <li>Consume 15-30g carbs per hour of activity</li>
            <li>Monitor closely for delayed lows up to 24 hours later</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Weightlifting and Resistance Training</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>May see initial blood sugar rise from adrenaline</li>
            <li>Followed by gradual decline as muscles recover</li>
            <li>Can start with slightly higher glucose (140-180 mg/dL)</li>
            <li>Watch for lows 4-12 hours post-workout</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Expect blood sugar spikes during intense intervals</li>
            <li>May need small correction after workout if consistently high</li>
            <li>Risk of delayed hypoglycemia as body recovers</li>
            <li>Monitor frequently during and after</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Safety Tips for Exercising with Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Always carry ID:</strong> Wear a medical alert bracelet or carry identification indicating you have Type 1 diabetes</li>
            <li><strong>Never exercise alone:</strong> Especially when trying new activities or intensities, have a workout partner who knows you have diabetes</li>
            <li><strong>Carry supplies:</strong> Always have glucose tablets, a glucagon emergency kit, your meter or CGM, and water</li>
            <li><strong>Inform others:</strong> Let coaches, trainers, or workout partners know you have diabetes and how to help in an emergency</li>
            <li><strong>Start slowly:</strong> When beginning a new exercise routine, start conservatively and increase intensity gradually as you learn your body's responses</li>
            <li><strong>Keep a log:</strong> Track pre/post glucose, insulin on board, carbs consumed, and activity details to identify patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Dehydration can affect blood sugar and performance</li>
            <li><strong>Listen to your body:</strong> If something feels off, stop and check your glucose</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Common Exercise Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Mistake 1: Not Planning Ahead</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Think about exercise timing relative to meals and insulin doses. Schedule workouts when you have minimal insulin on board, or plan to eat and reduce your bolus beforehand.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Mistake 2: Over-Correcting Highs Before Exercise</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> If blood sugar is elevated before a workout, resist the urge to take a full correction dose. The exercise itself will help lower glucose. A full correction plus exercise often leads to severe lows.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Mistake 3: Ignoring the Dawn Phenomenon</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Morning workouts can be tricky because of naturally rising glucose from dawn phenomenon. You may need less pre-workout carbs or can start with slightly higher blood sugar.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Mistake 4: Inconsistent Routine</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Sporadic, intense workouts are harder to manage than regular, consistent activity. Try to establish a routine so your body (and insulin needs) can adapt.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Mistake 5: Not Accounting for Adrenaline</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Competition, races, or trying new activities creates adrenaline that raises blood sugar. Expect higher readings than during similar training sessions and adjust accordingly.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Using Technology to Optimize Exercise Management</h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Modern diabetes technology has made exercising with Type 1 diabetes significantly safer and more manageable. <a href="cgm-vs-finger-sticks.html" class="text-pink-600 hover:underline">Continuous glucose monitors</a> allow real-time tracking of blood sugar trends during activity, alerting you to dangerous drops before you feel symptoms.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Smart diabetes platforms like <a href="https://sugarlytics.com" class="text-pink-600 hover:underline font-semibold">Sugarlytics</a> can analyze how specific types of exercise affect your glucose and help you develop personalized strategies. By tracking patterns across multiple workouts, the app learns your unique responses and can suggest optimal insulin adjustments and carb intake for different activities.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Building Your Personal Exercise Strategy</h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The most important thing to understand about exercise and diabetes is that everyone's response is different. Two people with Type 1 diabetes doing the same workout may have completely different blood sugar patterns. Your strategy should be based on <em>your</em> data, not generic guidelines.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Start by:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Choosing activities you enjoy and will stick with long-term</li>
            <li>Beginning conservatively and gradually increasing intensity</li>
            <li>Keeping detailed records of glucose, insulin, carbs, and activity</li>

          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health with Type 1 diabetes, but it requires planning, monitoring, and patience to master. Don't let the complexity discourage you from being active. With the right strategies and tools, you can safely enjoy any type of physical activity you choose.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Remember that managing exercise with diabetes is a learning process. You won't get it perfect every time, and that's okay. Each workout teaches you more about your body's unique responses. Over time, you'll develop an intuitive understanding of how to adjust insulin, carbs, and timing to stay active while maintaining stable blood sugar.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The benefits of regular physical activity—improved fitness, better insulin sensitivity, enhanced mood, and overall well-being—are absolutely worth the effort. You've got this!
